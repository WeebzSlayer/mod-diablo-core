## ✨ Core Features

### ⚔️ Combat & Mechanics

*   **💥 Cleave System (Dynamic AOE):** 
    *   Every damage-dealing spell or strike has a **30% chance** to trigger a Cleave.
    *   Deals **50% of the original damage** to all enemies within **8 yards**.
    *   *Visuals :* Uses in-game spell effects to signify the blast.

*   **🏃 ARPG Movement:** 
    *   Players receive a passive **+20% movement speed** boost automatically upon login.

*   **❤️ Health Globes:** 
    *   Slain enemies have a **5% chance** to drop a healing surge, instantly restoring **10% of your Maximum HP**.

*   **🧪 Potion Overhaul:** 
    *   Traditional flat-value healing is replaced. **Super Healing Potions** restore **35% of your Max HP**.
    *   Potions scale with your gear progress, ensuring they stay relevant from leveling to endgame.

### 👿 Monster & World Scaling

*   **📈 Dynamic Density:** 
    *   Monsters have a **25% chance** to spawn a clone (+20-30% density boost).
    *   **Recursion Protection:** Clones cannot clone themselves, preventing server crashes.

*   **🌟 Champion Spawns:** 
    *   Standard mobs have a **5% chance** to spawn as a "Champion."
    *   Champions have **3x Health**, **1.5x Damage**, and a larger scale (1.3x).
    *   *Visuals:* Champions are marked with a distinct visual glow/aura.

### 🌌 Nephalem Rifts & Persephone

*   **Persephone (The Rift Harbinger):** 
    *   A custom vendor NPC (ID : `99000`) who sells the scaled Super Potions.
    *   **Rift System:** Talking to her allows players to enter a Nephalem Rift.

*   **Rift Guardian:** 
    *   Inside the Rift, players face waves of high-density mobs leading to the **Rift Guardian** (ID : `99001`).
    *   **Performance Safeguard:** Bosses and Rift mobs use `TEMPSUMMON_TIMED_DESPAWN_OUT_OF_COMBAT` to prevent entity hoarding.

## 💡 Tips for Admins
   
   *  Scaling Gear: Because the potions and cleave use percentage-based math, this module works perfectly for High-Stat / Fun Servers as well as Blizzlike servers.
   
   *  Performance : If you notice lag with 100+ players, lower the Diablo.Density.Chance to 10.
